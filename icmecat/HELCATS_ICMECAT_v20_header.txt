This catalog has been made by getting the 3 times of each ICME (shock or disturbance begin, magnetic obstacle start and end) 
from the individual catalogs below, and then calculating all parameters again consistently from the data by us. 
The selection criteria are relatively simple: the event needs to have a clearly organized large-scale magnetic structure,
 which manifests itself through (1) an elevated total magnetic field and (2) a rotation in the field observed through the field components. 

The in situ data that were used for the catalog, with a size of 8 GB in total, including extra data files with magnetic field components 
in RTN coordinates that are not used for producing the catalog, can be downloaded in python pickle format as recarrays from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11973693 

The python source code for producing this catalog is available at https://github.com/cmoestl/heliocats icmecat.ipynb

Each event has unique identifier - the icmecat_id - which has a tag in it that indicates from which catalog the ICME times were taken:

STEREO-A:     Jian et al. (2018), tag: JIAN. 
STEREO-B:     Jian et al. (2018), tag: JIAN.

Comments: 

- Spacecraft positions are given in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial Coordinates (HEEQ) coordinates. 

- The coordinate system for all magnetic field components is SCEQ, except for Wind (HEEQ, which is the equivalent for SCEQ for Earth) and Ulysses (RTN, because of high latitude positions) and MAVEN (MSO). 
        Definition of SpaceCraft Equatorial Coordinates (SCEQ): 
        Z is the solar rotation axis. 
        Y is the cross product of Z and R, with R being the vector that points from the Sun to the spacecraft.
        X completes the right handed triad (and points away from the Sun). 
This system is thus like HEEQ but centered on the respective in situ spacecraft, so the SCEQ X and Y 
base vectors are rotated by the HEEQ longitude of the in situ spacecraft from HEEQ X and Y.
The Y vector is similar to the T vector in an RTN system for each spacecraft, but the X and Z vectors 
are rotated around Y compared to an RTN system. The differences between RTN and SCEQ for spacecraft within 
a few degrees of the solar equatorial plane are very small (within a few 0.1 nT usually).
We choose SCEQ for the advantage that a comparison of the data of multipoint CME events 
and comparisons to simulations are simpler because there is always a similar reference plane (the solar equatorial plane).

- Venus Express and MESSENGER do not have plasma parameters available. For events that do not have plasma parameters at Solar Orbiter or PSP, they may become available in the future.

- If there is no sheath or density pileup region, so the ICME starts immediately with a magnetic obstacle, the icme_start_time is similar to mo_start_time.

- At MESSENGER and VEX, for events cataloged by Simon Good, icme_start_time has been added by V. Krupar (Imperial College) and C. Moestl (IWF Graz). 

- For the calculation of the parameters at MESSENGER during the orbit around Mercury, all data points inside the bowshock of Mercury have been removed, 
according to a list thankfully provided to us by by R. Winslow, UNH, B. Anderson, APL, and Lydia Philpott, UBC. 

- Calculation of the magnetic obstacle parameters at VEX is done after approximate removal of the induced magnetosphere, with a modified equation as in 
Zhang et al. 2008 (doi: 10.1016/j.pss.2007.09.012), with a constant of 3.5 instead of 2.14/2.364, 
in order to account for a larger bowshock distance during solar maximum than studied in the Zhang et al. (2008) paper. 

- For MAVEN, all data inside the bow shock were removed with the model from Gruesbeck et al. (2018, doi:10.1029/2018JA025366) by C. Simon Wedlund (IWF Graz, Austria). 
From the remaining data, the median for each orbit is taken as 1 data point, resulting in a solar wind 
dataset at Mars with 4.5 hour time resolution. This is a far lower resolution than available at 1 AU, so the identification 
of ICMEs in the MAVEN data is not as straightforward as for data sets with higher time resolution.

- The identification of ICMEs for MAVEN was done as follows: (1) We looked for typical profiles for ICMEs in magnetic field (B) and speed (V).
(2) B needs to be elevated in ICMEs accompanied by a flat or declining profile in V. An elevation in B accompanied by a later gradual rise 
in V is a strong indicator for a high speed stream (HSS). (3) The discrimination between HSS and ICMEs was further strengthened with 
the help of a stream interaction region list for MAVEN by Huang et al. (2019, doi: 10.3847/1538-4357/ab25e9). 
(4) We additionally plotted the predicted CME arrivals with STEREO/HI (ARRCATv2.0), the dose rate measured on the Mars surface 
by MSL/RAD (e.g. Guo et al. (2018, doi: 10.1051/0004-6361/201732087)) and the speed of the WSA/HUX model for the 
background solar wind (Reiss et al. 2019, doi: 10.3847/1538-4365/aaf8b3). 
General guidance on space weather observed by MAVEN can be found in Lee et al. (2018, doi:10.1002/2016JA023495).
