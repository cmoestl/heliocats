SIR CATALOGUE v1.0 

This is the HELCATS stream interaction region (SRI) catalog, based on in situ magnetic field and bulk plasma observations in the heliosphere. 

This is version 1.0, released 2020-**-**. DOI: 10.6084/m9.**** 

The catalog is available as  python pandas dataframe (pickle), python numpy structured array (pickle), json, csv, xlsx, txt, hdf5, at 
https://helioforecast.space/sircat

Number of events in SIRCAT: 655 
ICME observatories: Wind, STEREO-A, STEREO-B.   
Time range: January 2007 - July 2018. 

Authors: Christian Moestl, Andreas Weiss, R. L. Bailey, Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Graz, Austria. Lan Jian, NASA, USA. 

Rules: If results are produced with this catalog for peer-reviewed scientific publications, please contact christian.moestl@oeaw.ac.at for possible co-authorship. 

This catalog has been made by getting the start and end times of each SIR from the individual catalogs below, and then calculating all parameters again consistently from the data by us. 
The in situ data that were used for the catalog, with a size of 8 GB in total, including extra data files with magnetic field components in RTN coordinates that are not used for producing the catalog and many other in situ data files, can be downloaded in python pickle format as recarrays from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11973693 
The python code for producing this catalog is available as part of https://github.com/cmoestl/heliocats 

Each icmecat_id has a tag in it that indicates from which catalog the ICME times were taken: 

Wind:       ****************** 
STEREO-A:   Jian et al. (2019), tag: JIAN.

Comments: 
- Spacecraft positions are given in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial Coordinates (HEEQ) coordinates. 
- The coordinate system for all magnetic field components is SCEQ, except for Wind (HEEQ, which is the equivalent for SCEQ for Earth). 
        Definition of SpaceCraft Equatorial Coordinates (SCEQ): 
        Z is the solar rotation axis. 
        Y is the cross product of Z and R, with R being the vector that points from the Sun to the spacecraft.
        X completes the right handed triad (and points away from the Sun). 
This system is thus like HEEQ but centered on the respective in situ spacecraft, so the SCEQ X and Y 
base vectors are rotated by the HEEQ longitude of the in situ spacecraft from HEEQ X and Y.
The Y vector is similar to the T vector in an RTN system for each spacecraft, but the X and Z vectors 
are rotated around Y compared to an RTN system. The differences between RTN and SCEQ for spacecraft within 
a few degrees of the solar equatorial plane are very small (within a few 0.1 nT usually).
We choose SCEQ because it has the advantage that a comparison between multipoint CME events 
and for comparison to simulations there is always a similar reference plane (the solar equatorial plane).
