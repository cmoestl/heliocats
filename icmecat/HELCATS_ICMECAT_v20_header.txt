ICME CATALOGUE v2.0 

This is the HELCATS interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) catalog, based on in situ magnetometer and plasma observations in the heliosphere. 

This is version 2.0, released in March 2020 with major update to the original version 1.0, originally a product of EU HELCATS project (2014-2017). 

Released 2020-??-??. DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.4588315.v2 

Number of events in ICMECAT: 677 

ICME observatories: Wind, Parker Solar Probe, STEREO-A, STEREO-B, Venus Express, MESSENGER, MAVEN, ULYSSES 

Time range: January 2007 - December 2018. 
 
Authors: Christian Moestl, Andreas Weiss, Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Graz, Austria,
Contributors: Peter Boakes, Alexey Isavnin, Emilia Kilpua, Reka Winslow, Brian Anderson, Lydia Philpott,
Vratislav Krupar, Jonathan Eastwood, Simon Good, Lan Jian, Teresa Nieves-Chinchilla.  

The catalog has been made by getting 3 times of the ICME (shock or disturbance begin, magnetic obstacle start and end) from these individual catalogs and then calculating all parameters again consistently from all data: 

Wind: Nieves-Chinchilla et al. 2018: 
STEREO-A, STEREO-B Lan Jian ....
VEX:  Good et al. 2018 
MESSENGER:  Good et al. 2018 Winslow et al. 2018 
MAVEN: Guo et al. (note that this is a mixture of methods MSL RAD, MAVEN and STEREO HI, MÃ¶stl et al. 2020)
Additionally we have added individual events at Ulysses,STEREO-B, STEREO-A, Parker Solar Probe, Wind and MAVEN.
