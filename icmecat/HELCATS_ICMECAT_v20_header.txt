Number of events in ICMECAT: 704
 
ICME observatories: Wind STEREO-A STEREO-B VEX MESSENGER ULYSSES MAVEN
           
Time range: January 2007 - December 2017.
           
Coordinate system for all spacecraft except Ulysses (RTN) and MAVEN (MSO):  SCEQ
           
SpaceCraft Equatorial Coordinates (SCEQ):
	Z is the solar rotation axis.
	X points from the Sun to the spacecraft, projected in the solar equatorial plane. 
	Y completes the right handed triad and points to solar west.
 This system is thus centered on the respective in situ spacecraft. 
 The solar equatorial plane as the reference plane is similar for all spacecraft.
           
Notes: 
(1) For all spacecraft: If there is no sheath region, so the ICME starts immediately with a magnetic obstacle, the ICME_START_TIME is similar to MO_START_TIME.
(2) For all spacecraft the times that are given are: the ICME_START_TIME (defined by shock or elevated magnetic field start), the MO_START_TIME,
    and the MO_END_TIME (MO for magnetic obstacle, defined by elevated field and smooth magnetic field rotations, but also includes (few) complex ejecta).
    Only for Wind the ICME_END_TIME is given extra, which contains interval of disturbed solar wind by the ICME until the values return to slow solar wind.
(3) MESSENGER: For ICME events catalogued by Winslow et al. the end time of the ICME is used for MO_END_TIME (not ICME_END_TIME). 
    Caution: after 2011 March 18 when MESSENGER is in orbit around Mercury the times are sometimes not exact because 
(4) MESSENGER and VEX: For events cataloged by Simon Good ICME_START_TIME has been added by V. Krupar (Imperial College) and C. Moestl (Graz).
(5) For the calculation of the parameters at MESSENGER during the orbit around Mercury, all data points inside the bowshock of Mercury have been removed.
    (according to a list thankfully provided to us by by R. Winslow, UNH, B. Anderson, APL, Lydia Philpott, UBC).
(6) For MVA to be applied to the MO interval, up to 25% of the MO data points may be NaN. Otherwise MVA results are set to NaN.
    This is relevant to MESSENGER in orbit around Mercury and VEX at Venus, where the ICME observation in the solar wind sometimes contains too few data points.
(7) Calculation of the MO parameters at VEX is done with an approximate removal of the induced magnetosphere, with a modified equation
    according to the one in the discussion of Zhang et al. 2008 (doi: 10.1016/j.pss.2007.09.012), with a constant of 3.5 instead of 2.14/2.364,
    in order to account for a larger bowshock distance during solar maximum than studied in this paper. 
(8) Similarly, for MAVEN data, all data inside the bow shock were removed with the model from Edberg et al. 2008 (JGR), including one standard deviation.
    For the remaining data the median for each orbit is taken as 1 data point. 4.5 hour time resolution.

updates in this version 20 compared to version 10: added MAVEN events, extended the Wind catalog to end of 2017 and added dynamic pressure parameters.
