ICME CATALOGUE v2.0 

This is the HELCATS interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) catalog, based on in situ magnetic field and bulk plasma observations in the heliosphere. 

This is version 2.0, released in April 2020 with a major update to the original version 1.0, originally a product of EU HELCATS project (2014-2017). 

Released 2020-**-**. DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.4588315.v2 *** 
The catalog is available as .p (python pickle), .xlsx, .csv, .html, .json at https://helioforecast.space/catalogs 

Number of events in ICMECAT: 678 
ICME observatories: Wind, STEREO-A, STEREO-B, Venus Express (VEX), MESSENGER, Ulysses, MAVEN, Parker Solar Probe (PSP).   
Time range: January 2007 - December 2018. 
 
Authors: Christian Moestl, Andreas Weiss, Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Graz, Austria.
Contributors: Peter Boakes, Alexey Isavnin, Emilia Kilpua, Reka Winslow, Brian Anderson, Lydia Philpott, Vratislav Krupar, Jonathan Eastwood, Simon Good, Lan Jian, Teresa Nieves-Chinchilla, Jingnan Guo, Mateja Dumbovic, Benoit Lavraud.  

This catalog has been made by getting the 3 times of each ICME (shock or disturbance begin, magnetic obstacle start and end) from the individual catalogs below, and then calculating all parameters again consistently from the data by us. 
Each icmecat_id has a tag in it that indicates from which catalog the ICME times were taken. 

Wind:       Nieves-Chinchilla et al. (2018), tag: NASA. 
STEREO-A:   Jian et al. (2018), tag: JIAN. 
STEREO-B:   Jian et al. (2018), tag: JIAN. 
VEX:        Good et al. (2018), tag: SGOOD 
MESSENGER:  Good et al. (2018), Winslow et al. (2018), tags: SGOOD, WINSLOW. 
MAVEN:      Möstl et al. (2020, in prep.), tag: MOESTL.
Ulysses:    Added by us, tag: MOESTL. 
PSP:        Added by us, tag: MOESTL. 
We have also added extra events at Ulysses, STEREO-A, PSP, MESSENGER, VEX, Wind and MAVEN (all tagged with MOESTL in icmecat_id).

Comments: 
- Spacecraft positions are given in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial Coordinates (HEEQ) coordinates. 
- Coordinate system for all magnetic field components is SCEQ except Ulysses and Parker Solar Probe (RTN), MAVEN (MSO) and Wind (HEEQ). 
        Definition of SpaceCraft Equatorial Coordinates (SCEQ): 
        Z is the solar rotation axis. 
        X points from the Sun to the spacecraft, projected in the solar equatorial plane. 
        Y completes the right handed triad and points to solar west. 
        This system is thus centered on the respective in situ spacecraft. 
        The solar equatorial plane as the reference plane is similar for all spacecraft.
- Venus Express and MESSENGER do not have plasma parameters available. 
- The identification of ICMEs for MAVEN is a mixture of methods using data from MSL/RAD, MAVEN and STEREO HI (Möstl et al. 2020, in prep.).
