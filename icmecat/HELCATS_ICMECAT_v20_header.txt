ARRIVAL CATALOGUE v2.0 

This ARRival CATalog (ARRCAT) models the arrivals of CMEs tracked in the STEREO heliospheric imagers EU HELCATS project (2014-2017). 
It lists predicted arrivals of solar coronal mass ejections at various spacecraft and planets with the STEREO heliospheric imager 
instruments, between April 2007 - April 2020, based on the HIGeoCAT catalog of CMEs established at RAL Space, UK (Harrison, Davies, Barnes). 
This is version 2.0, released 2020-**-**. DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.6356420 

Based on HIGeoCAT version ***
The catalog is available as  python pandas dataframe (pickle), python numpy structured array (pickle), json, csv, xlsx, txt, hdf5, at 
https://helioforecast.space/arrcat 
Number of events in ARRCAT: 1526
Targets: Earth L1, STEREO-A, STEREO-B,  Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe, Bepi Colombo, Venus, Mercury, Mars.

Parameters: 
    1: id: From HIGeoCAT, the unique identifier for the observed CME.
    2: sc: From HIGeoCAT, the HI observing STEREO spacecraft, (A=Ahead or B=Behind)
    3: sse_launch_time: From HIGeoCAT, launch time of the CME on the Sun, unit: UTC.
    4: target_name: Name of in situ target.
    5: sse_heeq_long: From HIGeoCAT, the HEEQ longitude of the CME apex propagation direction, unit: degree.
    6: target_detla: Difference in HEEQ longitude between central CME direction and target location, positive values: spacecraft is west of CME apex. unit: degree.
    7: sse_speed: From HIGeoCAT, speed of CME apex, unit: km/s.
    8: target_speed: CME arrival speed at target location, corrected for SSE shape. unit: km/s.
    9: target_arrival_time: CME arrival time at target location, corrected for SSE shape. unit: UTC.
    10: target_distance: Target distance from Sun, at CME launch time. unit: AU.
    11: target_heeq_lat: Target latitude in HEEQ, at CME launch time. unit: degree.
    12: target_heeq_lon: Target longitude in HEEQ, at CME launch time. unit: degree.
    13: target_pa: PA of target from HI observing STEREO spacecraft, unit: degree.
    14: pa_fit: From HICAT, PA along which time-elongation profile is extracted, unit: degree.
    15: pa_n: From HICAT, northern position angle of CME, unit: degree.
    16: pa_s: From HICAT, southernmost position angle of CME, unit: degree.
    17: pa_center: average of pa_n and pa_s, unit: degree.

Notes:

- We have applied modified method from Möstl & Davies (2013, Solar Physics) for calculating speeds 
and arrival times of the CMEs modeled with SSEF30 to all CMEs in the HELCATS HIGeoCAT catalog 
(see website helcats-fp7.eu, and Möstl et al. 2014, ApJ, for more details). 
If the SSEF30 circle hits a spacecraft or planet, an entry in ARRCAT is produced. 

- A new iterative method was used ***
