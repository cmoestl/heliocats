The leading edge or flank of the CME will reach STEREO A at 2024-06-28T03:43Z, Lucy at 2024-06-30T14:00Z, and Mars at 2024-06-29T00:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \\n\\nThe simulation also indicates that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-06-28T14:04Z (plus minus 7 hours).

The leading edge or flank of the CME will reach Lucy at 2024-06-12T20:49Z, Parker Solar Probe at 2024-06-09T06:57Z, STEREO A at 2024-06-10T04:16Z, Mars at 2024-06-11T16:30Z, and OSIRIS-APEX at 2024-06-10T20:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). \\n\\nThe simulation also indicates that the CME may impact NASA missions near Earth. Simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach NASA missions near Earth at about 2024-06-10T14:31Z (plus minus 7 hours). The roughly estimated expected range of the maximum Kp index is 4-6 (below minor to moderate).\\n   \\n  \\nLinks to the movies of the modeled event (includes CME: 2024-06-08T01:53:00-CME-001):\\n\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_anim.tim-den.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_anim.tim-vel.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_anim.tim-den-Stereo_A.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_anim.tim-vel-Stereo_A.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_timeline.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_PSP_timeline.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_STA_timeline.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_Lucy_timeline.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_Mars_timeline.gif\\nhttp://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/downloads/20240608_045000_2.0_ENLIL_CONE_Osiris_timeline.gif\\n\\n\\n## Notes: \\n\\nThis CME event (2024-06-08T01:53:00-CME-001) is associated with the M3.3 flare from AR13697 (S20W68) with ID 2024-06-08T00:39:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2024-06-08T00:51Z and the M9.7 flare from AR13697 (S17W68) with ID 2024-06-08T01:23:00-FLR-001 which peaked at 2024-06-08T01:49Z (see notifications 20240608-AL-001, 20240608-AL-002), SEP at GOES-P with ID 2024-06-08T02:25:00-SEP-001 (see notifications 20240608-AL-003, 20240608-AL-004, 20240608-AL-005, 20240608-AL-006), SEP at SOHO with ID 2024-06-08T03:34:00-SEP-001 (see notifications 20240608-AL-007), and SEP at STEREO A with ID 2024-06-08T04:14:00-SEP-001 (see notifications 20240608-AL-008, 20240608-AL-009).\\n\\n\\nSCORE CME typification system:\\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\\n\\n\\nCommunity Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI) Disclaimer\\n\\nData and/or information stored within the CCMC DONKI is provided \\\"as is\\\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

The source is likely a small filament eruption centered near S12E03 which begins to lift-off around 2024-05-23T06:45Z as seen in SDO AIA 131, 171, 193, 304 imagery. This eruption appears to deflect towards the southeast as it leaves the solar disk/initial source location. Post eruptive arcades begin to from in SDO AIA 171 and 193 imagery around 07:20Z. This event partially overlaps with CME: 2024-05-23T06:48Z. Possible arrival signature: Characterized by a minor amplification of magnetic field components with Btotal increasing from 3nT at 2024-05-26T14:35Z to 8nT at 20:13Z. There are a few minor increases in solar wind speed prior to the amplification magnetic field components, most notably an increase from ~350 km/s at 11:08Z to ~450 km/s at 13:05Z. There are no significant increases in temperature or density observed, beyond an increase in density to 8 N/cm^3 at 2024-05-27T03:31Z. An alternative arrival signature could be the one starting at 2024-05-27T02:42Z when it looks like the ICME crossed the spacecraft, with a slight descending profile in the plasma and magnetic field indicating a glancing blow and the possible start of the magnetic cloud around 06:12Z (according to Carlos Perez Alanis, LASSOS team).\",\n",

A distinct post-eruptive arcade forms around 2024-05-14T10:47Z across SDO AIA 131/171/193/211. Potential arrival signature is characterized by an initial Bt increase from 6nT->14nT, eventually increasing to almost 17nT at 2024-05-17T14:04Z. There is a jump in solar wind speed from 400 to 490 km/s and an increase in ion density. Bz stays negative for almost one day. Around 21Z there is a drop in density, followed by a drop in ion density, possibly indicating a flux rope. However, this arrival signature could also be from 2024-05-15T08:36Z CME.\",\n",

The start time is possibly earlier that 2024-05-09T18:23Z bc of a SOHO data gap. Coronal signatures include a sizable ejecta from AR 3664 seen directed north-westwards at ~17:36ZZ in AIA 304, an elongated dimming extending northward and westward of the flare location and stretching as far as the two coronal holes north of the equator. A possible arrival signature is characterized by a weak rotation of magnetic field components, with Btotal reaching a maximum of 15nT. A subsequent increase in speed is observed from ~770 km/s to 1005 km/s at 2024-05-12T00:555Z and a sharp increase in temperature. Density appears to decrease preceding this arrival signature. Possibly this is a flank impact/glancing blow arrival. Due to the increase in solar wind speed a coronal hole high speed stream may also be embedded in this signature, originating from a coronal hole which reached the central meridian on 2024-05-03.\",\n",

      "  \"cmeNote\" : \"[IN REVIEW] Halo CME visible in SOHO LASCO C2, C3, and STEREO A COR2 imagery. This halo is associated with the X2.2 class flare from AR13664 peaking at 2024-05-09T09:13Z. A clear EUV wave is visible in SDO/AIA 193 and 211 crossing towards the central meridian and towards the limb in the southwest. Post-eruptive arcades are present in SDO/AIA 193 and 131. Brightening is visible in SDO/AIA 304. Possible arrival signature is characterized by an initial sheath/compression of magnetic field components with Btotal reaching a maximum of 28nT. A subsequent increase in solar wind speed was observed from 643 km/s at 09:32Z to 900 km/s at 11:25Z. An increase in density was observed from ~2 N/cm^3 at 09:01Z to ~26 N/cm^3 at 09:22Z, with temperature exhibiting a sharp increase starting around 09:50Z. Due to the high solar wind speed observed with this arrival, it is possible this signature is associated with the arrival of CME: 2024-05-08T22:24Z and/or CME: 2024-05-09T09:24Z.\",\n",

The source is a large eruption and accompanying X1.0 and M9.8 flares from Active Region 13664 (S20W17) staring around 2024-05-08T21:08Z. Two rising loops are seen from Active Region 13664 (S20W17) staring around 2024-05-08T21:29Z and 22:08Z, respectively, as seen in SDO AIA 193/131, which likely resulted in two leading edges which very quickly combine in early frames of SOHO LASCO C2 imagery, and thus are considered one CME. A wide EUV wave and widely opening field lines are seen in SDO AIA 171/193. Possible arrival signature is characterized by an initial sheath/compression of magnetic field components with Btotal reaching a maximum of 28nT. A subsequent increase in solar wind speed was observed from 643 km/s at 09:32Z to 900 km/s at 11:25Z. An increase in density was observed from ~2 N/cm^3 at 09:01Z to ~26 N/cm^3 at 09:22Z, with temperature exhibiting a sharp increase starting around 09:50Z. Due to the high solar wind speed observed with this arrival, it is possible this signature is associated with the arrival of CME: 2024-05-08T22:24Z and/or CME: 2024-05-09T09:24Z.\",\n",

The source is a filament eruption near Active Region 13667 (S26E22) starting around 2024-05-08T08:15Z as seen in SDO AIA 131, 171, 193, 304 imagery. Filament material can be seen against the backdrop of the East limb as the material continues to leave the field of view in SDO AIA 304 around 19:35Z. A large dimming area is seen in SDO AIA 193 at this time, which appears to move southwest of the eruption site. Additionally, some post-eruptive arcades are seen in SDO AIA 171/193 starting around 20:00Z. This CME likely combined with several other CMEs from 05-07 to 05-09, with the combined front of the CMEs arriving at L1 at 2024-05-10T16:36Z. The possible arrival is characterized by a sharp increase in magnetic field components with Btotal increasing to 45nT at 16:44Z. A subsequent increase in solar wind speed is observed from 462 km/s at 16:36Z to 703 km/s at 16:48Z. Increases in density and temperature are also observed. A possible flux rope signature begins around 2024-05-10T21:38Z which corresponds to a second, more intense amplification of magnetic field components with Btotal reaching a maximum of 73nT. Within this possible flux rope feature, which extends to 2024-05-11T09:30Z, there are three noticeable decreases in density which may correspond to three CMEs that may have merged into the signature. Because of this, it is possible the signature is associated with the arrival of CME: 2024-05-08T05:36Z, CME: 2024-05-08T12:24Z, and/or CME: 2024-05-08T19:12Z. CME: 2024-05-07T03:12Z and CME: 2024-05-07T05:24Z measured slowly and may have been overtaken by CME: 2024-05-08T05:36Z. Preliminary analysis of this arrival signature was provided by Carlos Perez Alanis from the LASSOS team at NASA GSFC.\",\n",

The source is a large eruption from AR 3664, which included a long-duration M8.6 flare (S22W11) which peaked at 2024-05-08T12:04Z best seen in SDO AIA 131. An EUV wave and field line movement is observed in SDO AIA 94/131/171/211 with some surface brightening in SDO AIA 304. This flare+CME combo resulted in a small rise in protons observed at SOHO and GOES, but not enough for a threshold crossing. The start time used here is when the shock front emerges, with the brighter bulk front emerging ~2024-05-08T13:00Z. This CME likely combined with several other CMEs from 05-07 to 05-09, with the combined front of the CMEs arriving at L1 at 2024-05-10T16:36Z. The possible arrival is characterized by a sharp increase in magnetic field components with Btotal increasing to 45nT at 16:44Z. A subsequent increase in solar wind speed is observed from 462 km/s at 16:36Z to 703 km/s at 16:48Z. Increases in density and temperature are also observed.

It is now the largest of the regions, with an overall\\nareal coverage over 1,000 millionths. This region also produced several\\nM-class flares and an X1.0 flare at 08/0509 UTC. The X flare was\\naccompanied by Type II and IV sweeps and a 10.7 cm radio burst. A halo\\nCME associated with this event is first visible in C2 imagery near\\n08/0600 UTC. Preliminary modeling efforts showed an arrival time early\\non 11 May. However, additional analysis and modeling are ongoing. \\n\\nThe remaining spotted active regions were stable or in gradual decay and\\nlargely inactive.\"\n",

      "  \"cmeNote\" : \"[IN REVIEW] Earth-directed full halo seen in all coronagraphs. The source is a large eruption from AR 3664, which included two flares seen in SDO AIA 131, an initial M3.5 (S21W10) followed by the main long-duration X1.0 (S22W10) which peaked at 2024-05-08T04:30Z and 2024-05-08T05:09Z respectively. An EUV wave and field line movement is observed in SDO AIA 94/131/171/211 with some surface brightening in SDO AIA 304. This flare+CME combo resulted in a small rise in protons observed at SOHO and GOES, but not enough for a threshold crossing. This CME likely combined with several other CMEs from 05-07 to 05-09, with the combined front of the CMEs arriving at L1 at 2024-05-10T16:36Z. The possible arrival is characterized by a sharp increase in magnetic field components with Btotal increasing to 45nT at 16:44Z. A subsequent increase in solar wind speed is observed from 462 km/s at 16:36Z to 703 km/s at 16:48Z. Increases in density and temperature are also observed. A possible flux rope signature begins around 2024-05-10T21:38Z which corresponds to a second, more intense amplification of magnetic field components with Btotal reaching a maximum of 73nT. Within this possible flux rope feature, which extends to 2024-05-11T09:30Z, there are three noticeable decreases in density which may correspond to three CMEs that may have merged into the signature. Because of this, it is possible the signature is associated with the arrival of CME: 2024-05-08T05:36Z, CME: 2024-05-08T12:24Z, and/or CME: 2024-05-08T19:12Z. CME: 2024-05-07T03:12Z and CME: 2024-05-07T05:24Z measured slowly and may have been overtaken by CME: 2024-05-08T05:36Z. Preliminary analysis of this arrival signature was provided by Carlos Perez Alanis from the LASSOS team at NASA GSFC.\",\n",

This CME likely combined with several other CMEs from 05-07 to 05-09, with the combined front of the CMEs arriving at L1 at 2024-05-10T16:36Z. The possible arrival is characterized by a sharp increase in magnetic field components with Btotal increasing to 45nT at 16:44Z. A subsequent increase in solar wind speed is observed from 462 km/s at 16:36Z to 703 km/s at 16:48Z. Increases in density and temperature are also observed. A possible flux rope signature begins around 2024-05-10T21:38Z which corresponds to a second, more intense amplification of magnetic field components with Btotal reaching a maximum of 73nT. Within this possible flux rope feature, which extends to 2024-05-11T09:30Z, there are three noticeable decreases in density which may correspond to three CMEs that may have merged into the signature.

There is no shock but a steady growth in magnetic field to 16nT on 2024-05-06, accompanied by rotation of all 3 magnetic field components, with a prolonged bout of negative Bz (below 10 nT) on the evening of 2024-05-05.

The second CME (2024-04-15T06:48Z) will impact STEREO A around 2024-04-17T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) and Earth around 2024-04-17T16:00Z (plus minus 7 hours). The CMEs merge closer to each other after 1AU for impacts at Lucy and Psyche, with a slight separation remaining between the fronts. \\n\\nSCORE CME typification system:\\nS-type: CMEs with speeds less than 500 km/s\\nC-type: Common 500-999 km/s\\nO-type: Occasional 1000-1999 km/s\\nR-type: Rare 2000-2999 km/s\\nER-type: Extremely Rare >3000 km/s\\n\\n\\nCommunity Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI) Disclaimer\\n\\nData and/or information stored within the CCMC DONKI is provided \\\"as is\\\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME with ID 2024-04-14T11:12:00-CME-001 may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\\n\\n- STEREO A between about 2024-04-16T16:10Z and 2024-04-17T08:22Z (average arrival 2024-04-17T01:26Z) for 100% of simulations.\\n\\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-04-16T17:15Z and 2024-04-17T07:52Z (average arrival 2024-04-17T01:09Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 95% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-7 range (below minor to strong).\\n\\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_anim_tim-den.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_arrival_Earth.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_Earth_stack.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_arrival_STA.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-16_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061/20240414_111200_ncmes2_sims24_LAHAINA061_STA_stack.gif\\n\\n## Notes:\\nThe two CMEs in this simulation did not combine prior to impacting STEREO A and Earth, leading to a double peaked arrival in the STEREO A and Earth timelines. The second CME (2024-04-15T06:48Z) may impact STEREO A around 2024-04-17T12:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) and Earth around 2024-04-17T15:00Z (plus minus 7 hours) based on visual inspection of the simulation output.\\n\\nAdditionally, the combined flank of the CMEs were also predicted to impact Lucy at 2024-04-21T00:00Z (glancing blow) and Psyche at 2024-04-21T18:00Z (glancing blow) (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20240415-AL-002).  \\n\\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\\n\\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members.

A subsequent minor increase in solar wind speed was also observed from ~360 km/s at 07:34Z to 410 km/s at 07:59Z. This was accompanied by a slight increase in density as well, reaching 16 N(cm^-3) at 09:36Z.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \\n\\nEnsemble modeling update on CME with ID 2024-04-12T02:00:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20240412-AL-001).Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach:\\n\\n- STEREO A between about 2024-04-14T06:49Z and 2024-04-14T15:24Z (average arrival 2024-04-14T11:08Z) for 100% of simulations.\\n\\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-04-14T11:17Z and 2024-04-14T20:14Z (average arrival 2024-04-14T15:43Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 65% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\\n\\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_anim_tim-den.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_arrival_Earth.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_Earth_stack.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_arrival_STA.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060_STA_stack.gif\\n\\n## Notes:\\nThis CME event (2024-04-12T02:00:00-CME-001) is also predicted to impact Lucy at 2024-04-17T00:00Z (glancing blow) and Psyche at 2024-04-19T06:00Z (glancing blow) (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notification 20240412-AL-001).\\n\\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\\n\\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\\n\\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-04-12_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060/Detailed_results_20240412_020000_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA060.txt\\n###\\n\\n\\nCommunity Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI) Disclaimer\\n\\nData and/or information stored within the CCMC DONKI is provided \\\"as is\\\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

ENSEMBLE PRODUCT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT MODE. PLEASE LET US KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY SUGGESTIONS FOR MODIFICATIONS.  \\n\\nEnsemble modeling update on CMEs with IDs 2024-03-23T01:25:00-CME-001 and 2024-03-23T01:48:00-CME-001 (see previous notification 20240323-AL-013). Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2024-03-24T13:59Z and 2024-03-25T04:12Z (average arrival 2024-03-24T19:28Z) for 100% of simulations.\\n\\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-03-24T16:47Z and 2024-03-25T07:59Z (average arrival 2024-03-24T22:32Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 57% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\\n\\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_anim_tim-den.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_arrival_Earth.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_Earth_stack.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_arrival_STA.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_STA_stack.gif\\n\\n## Notes:\\nThese CME events (2024-03-23T01:25:00-CME-001 and 2024-03-23T01:48:00-CME-001) are also predicted to have an impact Solar Orbiter at 2024-03-23T14:01Z, Psyche at 2024-03-27T22:00Z (minor impact) and Lucy at 2024-03-27T16:00Z (minor impact) (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notifications 20240323-AL-012 and 20240323-AL-013)\\n\\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set. This approach allows a mapping of initial CME parameter uncertainties into a statistical characterization of CME arrival times and impact at locations of interest.\\n\\nDescription of links: For each location, the first link shows the WSA-ENLIL+Cone model animation for the median CME input parameters, the second link shows the probabilistic distribution of predicted arrival times histogram, and the third link shows a stack plot of the WSA-ENLIL+Cone modeled magnetic field, velocity, density, and temperature for all ensemble members. For missions near Earth, a histogram of the probabilistic Kp forecast is also provided.\\n\\nFor the full details of the modeled event, please go here:\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/Detailed_results_20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059.txt\\n\\n\\nCommunity Coordinated Modeling Center Database Of Notifications, Knowledge, Information (CCMC DONKI) Disclaimer\\n\\nData and/or information stored within the CCMC DONKI is provided \\\"as is\\\" without any warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or statutory, including, but not limited to, any warranty that the data and/or information will conform to specifications, any implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or freedom from infringement, any warranty that the information will be error free, or any warranty that documentation, if provided, will conform to the data and/or information.

Based on analysis by the Moon to Mars Space Weather Analysis Office and heliospheric ensemble modeling carried out at the Community Coordinated Modeling Center, it is estimated that the CME may impact STEREO A. For 24 ensemble members (see notes section), simulations indicate that the leading edge of the CME will reach STEREO A between about 2024-03-24T13:59Z and 2024-03-25T04:12Z (average arrival 2024-03-24T19:28Z) for 100% of simulations.\\n\\nAdditionally the CME is estimated to reach NASA missions near Earth between about 2024-03-24T16:47Z and 2024-03-25T07:59Z (average arrival 2024-03-24T22:32Z) for 100% of simulations.  The ensemble-based forecast indicates that there is a 57% chance for the maximum Kp index to be in the 4-6 range (below minor to moderate).\\n\\nLinks to the ensemble details of the modeled event:\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_anim_tim-den.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_arrival_Earth.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_Earth_stack.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_arrival_STA.gif\\nhttps://iswa.gsfc.nasa.gov/ENSEMBLE/2024-03-23_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059/20240323_012500_ncmes1_sims24_LAHAINA059_STA_stack.gif\\n\\n## Notes:\\nThese CME events (2024-03-23T01:25:00-CME-001 and 2024-03-23T01:48:00-CME-001) are also predicted to have an impact Solar Orbiter at 2024-03-23T14:01Z, Psyche at 2024-03-27T22:00Z (minor impact) and Lucy at 2024-03-27T16:00Z (minor impact) (plus minus 7 hours) based on previous heliospheric modeling (see notifications 20240323-AL-012 and 20240323-AL-013)\\n\\nEnsemble CME modeling at M2M is performed by building sets of initial CME parameters and carrying out separate simulations for each set.

A large western portion of the filament appears to deflect south/southeast, which is likely associated with this event. Dimming is visible from the eruption site in SDO AIA 193 shortly after the filament lifts-off and field line movement can be seen near the S/SW limb at this time in SDO AIA 171. Post-eruptive loops begin to form around 04:30Z. This event partially overlaps CME: 2024-03-17T03:12Z, which also likely stems from the same filament eruption. Arrival signature is likely of a combined arrival of these two CMEs. It is characterized by an increase in magnetic field to 14nT in what is likely the CME sheath, followed after 2024-03-21T10:49Z by smooth rotation of magnetic field components in what is likely the flux rope.\",\n",

Dimming is visible from the eruption site shortly after the filament lifts-off, starting around 02:37Z, seen in SDO AIA 193 and field line movement can be seen near the S/SW limb at this time in SDO AIA 171. Post-eruptive loops begin to form around 04:30Z as seen in SDO AIA 171 and 193 imagery. This event partially overlaps CME: 2024-03-17T03:36Z, which also likely occurs from the same filament eruption. Arrival signature is likely of a combined arrival of these two CMEs. It is characterized by an increase in magnetic field to 14nT in what is likely the CME sheath, followed after 2024-03-21T10:49Z by smooth rotation of magnetic field components in what is likely the flux rope.\",\n",

Not seen in STEREO A COR2 due to a data gap from 2024-02-28T13:23Z to 2024-02-29T03:09Z. Arrival note: Characterized initially as a jump in Bt from around 3nT to 5nT, with more notable spikes in density, temperature, and speed from around 280 km/s to 320 km/s. Bt slowly rose to around 19nT by 2024-03-03T11:00Z with a long, sustained southward Bz reaching -16nT. The shock is not clearly observed (there is no abrupt increase in plasma data) and  STA impact happens first and the sheath and its rotation are clearly seen and with a slight lag at L1, so the most likely candidates for this arrival are CME 2024-02-28T17:48Z and 2024-02-28T23:12:00-CME-001.\",\n",

This eruption is best seen as dimming starting around 2024-02-10T06:96Z in SDO AIA 193. Following this eruption, post-eruptive arcades/rising loops are seen near AR 3576. This eruption is partially obscured by an eclipse in SDO AIA imagery from 2024-02-10T06:55Z-07:22Z. Opening field lines are visible in SDO AIA 171 and post-eruptive loops are best seen in SDO AIA 94. The eruption is also visible in STEREO A EUV 195/304. | Arrival note: Minor increase in B_total, solar wind speed, and temperature. A gradual increase in density follows the start of the arrival and is drawn out over the course of 24 hours.

This CME is associated with a large filament eruption stretching from ~S45E10 to ~S20W20, centered around S35W10. The source eruption is best seen in SDO/AIA 304 starting around 2024-01-22T08:30Z. Associated dimming (SDO/AIA 193), brightening (SDO/AIA 304), and post-eruptive arcades (SDO/AIA 193, 171, and 211) are visible. The filament appears to deflect southward as it erupts. Possible arrival signature: a change in the solar wind pattern, with B total sharply increasing from under 3 nT to over 6nT, followed by another jump to just above 10nT around 14Z. There is also rotation of two magnetic field components, that after 14Z potentially resembles signature of a glancing blow/arrival of a flux rope.\",\n",
