    "# (1) For all spacecraft: If there is no sheath region, so the ICME starts immediately with a magnetic obstacle, the ICME_START_TIME is similar to MO_START_TIME.\n",
    "# (2) For all spacecraft the times that are given are: the ICME_START_TIME (defined by shock or elevated magnetic field start), the MO_START_TIME,\n",
    "#     and the MO_END_TIME (MO for magnetic obstacle, defined by elevated field and smooth magnetic field rotations, but also includes (few) complex ejecta).\n",
    "#     Only for Wind the ICME_END_TIME is given extra, which contains interval of disturbed solar wind by the ICME until the values return to slow solar wind.\n",
    "# (3) MESSENGER: For ICME events catalogued by Winslow et al. the end time of the ICME is used for MO_END_TIME (not ICME_END_TIME). \n",
    "#     Caution: after 2011 March 18 when MESSENGER is in orbit around Mercury the times are sometimes not exact because \n",
    "# (4) MESSENGER and VEX: For events cataloged by Simon Good ICME_START_TIME has been added by V. Krupar (Imperial College) and C. Moestl (Graz).\n",
    "# (5) For the calculation of the parameters at MESSENGER during the orbit around Mercury, all data points inside the bowshock of Mercury have been removed.\n",

    "#     in order to account for a larger bowshock distance during solar maximum than studied in this paper. \n",
