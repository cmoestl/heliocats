ARRIVAL CATALOGUE 2.0 

In this ARRival CATalog (ARRCAT), the arrivals of solar coronal mass ejections that were 
tracked in the STEREO heliospheric imagers in the HELCATS project are calculated.
ARRCAT lists modeled arrivals of CMEs at various spacecraft and planets, 
between April 2007 - April 2020, based on the HIGeoCAT catalog of CMEs 
established at RAL Space, UK (R. A. Harrison, J. A. Davies, D. Barnes). 

This is version 2.0, released 2020-05-13. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12271292

It is based on this HIGeoCAT version: https://www.helcats-fp7.eu/catalogues/data/HCME_WP3_V06.vot using the SSEF30 model.

The catalog is available as python pandas dataframe (pickle), 
python numpy arrays (pickle, as recarray and structured array), 
npy (numpy, no pickle), json, csv, xlsx, txt, hdf5, html at 
https://helioforecast.space/arrcat and https://www.helcats-fp7.eu

Number of events in ARRCAT: 1548
Targets: Earth_L1, STEREO-A, STEREO-B, Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Bepi Colombo, Ulysses, Venus, Mercury, Mars.

Parameters: 

    0: id: From HIGeoCAT, the unique identifier for the observed CME.
    1: sc: From HIGeoCAT, the HI observing STEREO spacecraft, (A=Ahead or B=Behind)
    2: target_name: Name of in situ target.
    3: sse_launch_time: From HIGeoCAT, launch time of the CME at Sun center, unit: UTC.
    4: target_arrival_time: CME arrival time at target location, corrected for SSE shape (Möstl and Davies, 2013). unit: UTC.
    5: target_arrival_time_err: Error of CME arrival time at target location, solely based on error in parameter sse_speed_err. unit: hours.
    6: target_distance: Target distance from Sun, at CME arrival time. unit: AU.
    7: target_heeq_lon: Target longitude in HEEQ, at CME arrival time. unit: degree.
    8: target_heeq_lat: Target latitude in HEEQ, at CME arrival time. unit: degree.
    9: target_delta: Difference in HEEQ longitude between central CME direction and target location at CME arrival time, 
       positive values: spacecraft is west of CME apex. unit: degree.
    10: sse_heeq_lon: From HIGeoCAT, the HEEQ longitude of the CME apex propagation direction, unit: degree.
    11: sse_heeq_lat: From HIGeoCAT, the HEEQ latitude of the CME apex propagation direction, unit: degree.
    12: sse_speed: From HIGeoCAT, speed of the CME apex, unit: km/s.
    13: sse_speed_err: From HIGeoCAT, error in the speed of the CME apex, unit: km/s.
    14: target_speed: CME arrival speed at target location, corrected for SSE shape (Möstl and Davies, 2013). unit: km/s.
    15: target_speed_err: Error in CME arrival speed at target location, corrected for SSE shape (Möstl and Davies, 2013). unit: km/s.
    16: pa_fit: From HIGeoCAT, PA along which time-elongation profile is extracted, unit: degree.
    17: pa_n: From HIGeoCAT, northern position angle of CME, unit: degree.
    18: pa_s: From HIGeoCAT, southernmost position angle of CME, unit: degree.
    19: pa_center: average of pa_n and pa_s, unit: degree.

Notes:

    - We have modified the calculation of CME arrival time here by a new iterative method compared to Möstl et al. (2014, 2017). 
      In the first iteration, the sse_launch_time is used to calculate the target HEEQ position, and in subsequent three iterations the 
      newly calculated arrival time is employed each time for the target HEEQ position at the newly calculated arrival time. 
      In this way we avoid an error of a few degrees in the arrival target location (see also Möstl et al. 2017). 
    - The analytical formulas for calculating the speeds and arrival times of the CMEs modeled with SSEF30, 
      corrected for the SSEF30 circular shape, can be found in Möstl & Davies (2013).
