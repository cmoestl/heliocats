ARRIVAL CATALOGUE 2.0 

In this ARRival CATalog (ARRCAT), the arrivals of solar coronal mass ejections that were 
tracked in the STEREO heliospheric imagers in the HELCATS project are calculated.
ARRCAT lists modeled arrivals of CMEs at various spacecraft and planets, 
based on the HIGeoCAT catalog of CMEs established at RAL Space, UK (D. Barnes, J. A. Davies, R. A. Harrison). 

This is version 2.0, released 2020-May-13, updated 2021-Oct-1. https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.12271292

It is based on this HIGeoCAT version: https://www.helcats-fp7.eu/catalogues/data/HCME_WP3_V06.vot using the SSEF30 model.

The catalog is available as python pandas dataframe (pickle), 
python numpy arrays (pickle, as recarray and structured array), 
npy (numpy, no pickle), json, csv, xlsx, txt, hdf5, html at 
https://helioforecast.space/arrcat and https://www.helcats-fp7.eu

Number of events in ARRCAT: 1677
Targets: Earth_L1, STEREO-A, STEREO-B, Solar Orbiter, Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Bepi Colombo, Ulysses, Venus, Mercury, Mars.

Comments

    - We have modified the calculation of CME arrival time here by a new iterative method compared to Moestl et al. (2014, 2017). 
      In the first iteration, the sse_launch_time is used to calculate the target HEEQ position. 
      In subsequent three iterations, we use the arrival time from the previous iteration (instead of sse_launch time) 
      to calculate the target HEEQ position. 
      In this way we avoid an error of a few degrees in the arrival target location (see also Moestl et al. 2017). 
    - The analytical formulas for calculating the speeds and arrival times of the CMEs modeled with SSEF30, 
      corrected for the SSEF30 circular shape, can be found in Moestl & Davies (2013).
