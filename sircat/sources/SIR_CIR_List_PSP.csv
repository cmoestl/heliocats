#Description:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The event list is compiled by Dr. Robert C. Allen (Robert.Allen@jhuapl.edu) based on visual inspection for reference purposes only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#Not all of the desired data are always available for event identification, such as during Ka-band downlinks or certain instrument operation modes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#As such, some of the event identifications are marked as ambiguous. Since the interaction region around the interface is the focus of this list,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
#the continuous rise of fast wind beyond the interaction region is not included in the listed times. For event details and information on ambiguous,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#events, please contact Dr. Robert C. Allen. The intention of this list is to be an aid for research, and no guarantees as to its accuracy are given.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#Authors of studies using this list are encouraged to check values and structures with the latest public data file version, as these events may have",,,,,,,,,,,,,
#been initially analyzed with data using outdated calibrations.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Some events are marked with an ambiguous event marker. These ambiguous markers are denoted by three possible values. A value of 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#denotes an event that has all desired data for identification throughout the event. A value of 1 denotes an event that has most of the desired data,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#for most of the event, but with some minor gaps (usually due to Ka-band downlinks or certain instrument operational modes). These events",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#(ambiquous marker=1) are events with a high confidence that it is an SIR or CIR, although some of the fields (e.g., Pmax) may not be reliable",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#due to data gaps. Finally, events with the ambiquous marker set to 2 denote events that are likely an SIR or CIR, but the gaps or data availablity",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#make this difficult to fully discern, and due to most of the velocity increase ocurring during a data gap, all of the supporting values (e.g., Pmax)",,,,,,,,,,,,,
#are set to a fill value (-1).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The CIR marker distinguishes between events that are SIRs (0) and CIRs (1). This is based on comparing to 1 au measurments to determine if,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#the structure has persisted for more than one solar rotation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#If either the STEREO-A Conjunction or L1 Conjuction markers are 1, then the structure observed at PSP was also oberved at STEREO-A and/or",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#L1 (ACE and/or Wind), respectively. For the times of those observations contact Dr. Robert C. Allen for an additional list. These lists will",,,,,,,,,,,,,
#be made public shortly as data is made available. A value of 2 indicates this is still in the works.,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The criteria for event classification are based on the following two papers:,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#L. Jian, C.T. Russell, J.G. Luhmann, and R.M. Skoug, Properties of Stream Interactions at One AU during 1995 - 2004,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#Solar Phys., 239, 337-392, 2006.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#L.K. Jian, C.T. Russell, J.G. Luhmann, A.B. Galvin, K.D.C. Simunac, Solar Wind Observations at STEREO: 2007 - 2011,",,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#Amer. Inst. Phys. Proceedings of Solar Wind 13, 1539, 191-194, doi: 10.1063/1.4811020, 2013.",,,,,,,,,,,,,
