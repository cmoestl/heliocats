#Description:
#The event list is compiled by Dr. Robert C. Allen (Robert.Allen@jhuapl.edu) based on visual inspection for reference purposes only.
"#Not all of the desired data are always available for event identification, and some of the data used is preliminary, rather than final."
"#As such, some of the event identifications are marked as ambiguous. Since the interaction region around the interface is the focus of this list,"
#the continuous rise of fast wind beyond the interaction region is not included in the listed times. Only SIRs and CIRs observed by ACE and/or Wind
#that were also observed by PSP are included in this list and as such it is not intended to be used as extensive ACE or Wind SIR or CIR list. For event
"#details and information on ambiguous events, please contact Dr. Robert C. Allen. The intention of this list is to be an aid for research, and no"
#guarantees as to its accuracy are given. Authors of studies using this list are encouraged to check values and structures with the latest public
"#data file version, as these events may have been initially analyzed with data using outdated calibrations."
#
#Some events are marked with an ambiguous event marker. These ambiguous markers are denoted by three possible values. A value of 0
#denotes an event that has all desired data for identification throughout the event and that the data are final. A value of 1 denotes an event that has
"#most of the desired data for most of the event, but with either some minor gaps or that the event was selected using preliminary ACE or Wind data. These"
"#events (ambiquous marker=1) are events with a high confidence that it is an SIR or CIR, although some of the fields (e.g., Pmax) may not be reliable"
"#due to data gaps or the use of preliminary data. Once final data is released by the relavent ACE or Wind team, the list will be updated and the ambiguous"
"#marker will be changed accordingly. Finally, events with the ambiquous marker set to 2 denote events that are likely an SIR or CIR, but the gaps or data"
"#availablity make this difficult to fully discern, and due to most of the velocity increase ocurring during a data gap, all of the supporting values"
"#(e.g., Pmax) are set to a fill value (-1)."
#
#The CIR marker distinguishes between events that are SIRs (0) and CIRs (1). This is based on comparing to both PSP and L1 (ACE/Wind) measurments to
#determine if the structure has persisted for more than one solar rotation.
#
#The PSP event marker denotes the event number in the companion PSP SIR list.
#
"#If the STEREO-A Conjuction marker is 1, then the structure observed at PSP was also oberved at STEREO-A."
#
#If the obervations were observed to have an associated Shock (based on visual inspection) it is marked as a (1) in the Shock column
#If the observations were observed to be near a Heliospheric Current Sheet crossing then the HCS column is marked as (1)
#
#The criteria for event classification are based on the following two papers:
"#L. Jian, C.T. Russell, J.G. Luhmann, and R.M. Skoug, Properties of Stream Interactions at One AU during 1995 - 2004,"
"#Solar Phys., 239, 337-392, 2006."
"#L.K. Jian, C.T. Russell, J.G. Luhmann, A.B. Galvin, K.D.C. Simunac, Solar Wind Observations at STEREO: 2007 - 2011,"
"#Amer. Inst. Phys. Proceedings of Solar Wind 13, 1539, 191-194, doi: 10.1063/1.4811020, 2013."
