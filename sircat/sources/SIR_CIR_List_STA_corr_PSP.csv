#Description:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The event list is compiled by Dr. Robert C. Allen (Robert.Allen@jhuapl.edu) based on visual inspection for reference purposes only.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#Not all of the desired data are always available for event identification, and some of the data used is preliminary, rather than final.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#As such, some of the event identifications are marked as ambiguous. Since the interaction region around the interface is the focus of this list,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#the continuous rise of fast wind beyond the interaction region is not included in the listed times. Only SIRs and CIRs observed by STEREO-A that,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#were also observed by PSP are included in this list and as such it is not intended to be used as extensive STEREO-A SIR or CIR list. For event,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#details and information on ambiguous events, please contact Dr. Robert C. Allen. The intention of this list is to be an aid for research, and no",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#guarantees as to its accuracy are given. Authors of studies using this list are encouraged to check values and structures with the latest public,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#data file version, as these events may have been initially analyzed with data using outdated calibrations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#Some events are marked with an ambiguous event marker. These ambiguous markers are denoted by three possible values. A value of 0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#denotes an event that has all desired data for identification throughout the event and that the data are final. A value of 1 denotes an event that has,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#most of the desired data for most of the event, but with either some minor gaps or that the event was selected using preliminary STEREO-A data. These",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#events (ambiquous marker=1) are events with a high confidence that it is an SIR or CIR, although some of the fields (e.g., Pmax) may not be reliable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#due to data gaps or the use of preliminary data. Once final data is released by the relavent STEREO-A team, the list will be updated and the ambiguous",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#marker will be changed accordingly. Finally, events with the ambiquous marker set to 2 denote events that are likely an SIR or CIR, but the gaps or data",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#availablity make this difficult to fully discern, and due to most of the velocity increase ocurring during a data gap, all of the supporting values",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#(e.g., Pmax) are set to a fill value (-1).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The CIR marker distinguishes between events that are SIRs (0) and CIRs (1). This is based on comparing to both PSP and L1 (ACE/Wind)  measurments to,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#determine if the structure has persisted for more than one solar rotation.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The PSP event marker denotes the event number in the companion PSP SIR list.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#If the L1 Conjuction marker is 1, then the structure observed at PSP was also oberved at L1 (ACE and/or Wind).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#If the obervations were observed to have an associated Shock (based on visual inspection) it is marked as a (1) in the Shock column,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#If the observations were observed to be near a Heliospheric Current Sheet crossing then the HCS column is marked as (1),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
#The criteria for event classification are based on the following two papers:,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"#L. Jian, C.T. Russell, J.G. Luhmann, and R.M. Skoug, Properties of Stream Interactions at One AU during 1995 - 2004,",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
