SIR CATALOGUE v1.0 

This is the HELIO4CAST stream interaction region (SIR) and high speed stream (HSS) catalog,
based on in situ magnetic field and bulk plasma observations in the heliosphere. 
It is a merged catalog created from individual ones made by Lan Jian et al., Maxim Grandin et al. and Hui Huang et al. (see references).

This is version 1.0, released 2020-06-10, updated 2020-06-11 DOI: 10.6084/m9.figshare.12416906 

The catalog is available as  python pandas dataframe (pickle), json, csv, xlsx, txt, html at 
https://helioforecast.space/sircat 

Number of events in SIRCAT: 1018 
ICME observatories: Wind, STEREO-A, STEREO-B, MAVEN   
Time range: January 2007 - December 2017 (Wind), January 2007 - July 2018 (STEREO). December 2014 - January 2018 (MAVEN). 

Authors: Christian Moestl, Andreas J. Weiss, R. L. Bailey, Martin A. Reiss, Space Research Institute, Austrian Academy of Sciences, Graz, Austria.

Rules: If results are produced with this catalog for peer-reviewed scientific publications, 
please contact christian.moestl@oeaw.ac.at, lan.jian@nasa.gov, maxime.grandin@helsinki.fi for possible co-authorships. 

This catalog has been made by getting the start and end times of each high speed stream from the 
individual catalogs, and then calculating all parameters again consistently from the data by us. 
The in situ data that were used for the creating catalog, with a size of 8 GB in total, including extra data 
files with magnetic field components in RTN coordinates and other spacecrat that are not used for producing this catalog, 
can be downloaded in python pickle format as recarrays from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.11973693.v7 
The python code for producing this catalog is available at https://github.com/cmoestl/heliocats sircat.ipynb 

Each sircat_id has a tag in it that indicates from which catalog the ICME times were taken: 

Wind:       Grandin et al. (2019), tag: GRANDIN 
STEREO-A:   Jian et al. (2019), tag: JIAN. 
STEREO-B:   Jian et al. (2019), tag: JIAN. 
MAVEN:      Huang et al. (2019), tag: HUANG.

Comments: 
- The STEREO catalog contains the SIR start, stream interface and SIR end times. We use their stream interface time as our hss_start_time. 
- The MAVEN catalog has similar times as the STEREO catalog.
- Earth SIR/HSS list: This catalog directly gives the hss_start_time and the hss_end_time, but no SIR times.  
- The times in the Earth SIR/HSS list have been modified to 1 hour earlier as these times were 
originally given for the magnetopause, but the Wind spacecraft is located at the L1 point. 
One hour is practically equivalent to the propagation time of a 400 km/s slow solar wind 
from the L1 point to the magnetopause.
- Spacecraft positions are given in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial Coordinates (HEEQ) coordinates. 
- The coordinate system for all magnetic field components is SCEQ, except for Wind (HEEQ, which is the equivalent for SCEQ for Earth). 
        Definition of SpaceCraft Equatorial Coordinates (SCEQ): 
        Z is the solar rotation axis. 
        Y is the cross product of Z and R, with R being the vector that points from the Sun to the spacecraft.
        X completes the right handed triad (and points away from the Sun). 
This system is thus like HEEQ but centered on the respective in situ spacecraft, so the SCEQ X and Y 
base vectors are rotated by the HEEQ longitude of the in situ spacecraft from HEEQ X and Y.
The Y vector is similar to the T vector in an RTN system for each spacecraft, but the X and Z vectors 
are rotated around Y compared to an RTN system. The differences between RTN and SCEQ for spacecraft within 
a few degrees of the solar equatorial plane are very small (within a few 0.1 nT usually).
We choose SCEQ because it has the advantage that a comparison between multipoint CME events 
and for comparison to simulations there is always a similar reference plane (the solar equatorial plane).
