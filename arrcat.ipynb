If the SSEF30 circle hits a spacecraft or planet, an entry in ARRCAT is produced.\n",

For Rosetta, no arrivals are calculated during its deep space hibernation from 2011 June 8 to 2014 January 20. For MESSENGER, MSL and MAVEN ARRCAT covers both the cruise and orbit phases of those missions. \n",

    "- Spacecraft positions are given in Heliocentric Earth Equatorial Coordinates (HEEQ) coordinates. \\n\\\n",
    "- The coordinate system for all magnetic field components is SCEQ, except for Wind (HEEQ, which is the equivalent for SCEQ for Earth) and Ulysses (RTN, because of high latitude positions) and MAVEN (MSO). \\n\\\n",
    "        Definition of SpaceCraft Equatorial Coordinates (SCEQ): \\n\\\n",
    "        Z is the solar rotation axis. \\n\\\n",
    "        Y is the cross product of Z and R, with R being the vector that points from the Sun to the spacecraft.\\n\\\n",
    "        X completes the right handed triad (and points away from the Sun). \\n\\\n",
    "This system is thus like HEEQ but centered on the respective in situ spacecraft, so the SCEQ X and Y \\n\\\n",
    "base vectors are rotated by the HEEQ longitude of the in situ spacecraft from HEEQ X and Y.\\n\\\n",
    "The Y vector is similar to the T vector in an RTN system for each spacecraft, but the X and Z vectors \\n\\\n",
    "are rotated around Y compared to an RTN system. The differences between RTN and SCEQ for spacecraft within \\n\\\n",
    "a few degrees of the solar equatorial plane are very small (within a few 0.1 nT usually).\\n\\\n",
    "We choose SCEQ because it has the advantage that a comparison between multipoint CME events \\n\\\n",
    "and for comparison to simulations there is always a similar reference plane (the solar equatorial plane).\\n\\n\\\n",
    "- Venus Express and MESSENGER do not have plasma parameters available. \\n\\\n",
    "- If there is no sheath or density pileup region, so the ICME starts immediately with a magnetic obstacle, the icme_start_time is similar to mo_start_time.\\n\\\n",
    "- At MESSENGER and VEX, for events cataloged by Simon Good, icme_start_time has been added by V. Krupar (Imperial College) and C. Möstl (IWF Graz). \\n\\\n",
    "- For the calculation of the parameters at MESSENGER during the orbit around Mercury, all data points inside the bowshock of Mercury have been removed, \\\n",
    "according to a list thankfully provided to us by by R. Winslow, UNH, B. Anderson, APL, and Lydia Philpott, UBC. \\n\\\n",
    "- Calculation of the magnetic obstacle parameters at VEX is done after approximate removal of the induced magnetosphere, with a modified equation \\n\\\n",
    "in Zhang et al. 2008 (doi: 10.1016/j.pss.2007.09.012), with a constant of 3.5 instead of 2.14/2.364,\\\n",
    "in order to account for a larger bowshock distance during solar maximum than studied in this paper. \\n\\\n",
    "- For MAVEN, all data inside the bow shock were removed with the model from Gruesbeck et al. (2018, https://doi.org/10.1029/2018JA025366) by C. Simon \\\n",
